        <h2>Our Donation Plan</h2>
        <p>All donations to this fund will support hunger relief efforts in Sylhet. Initially, the fund will help local, vetted partners address the affected communities' immediate needs, such as access to food, clean water, and basic sanitation. The fund will later transition to focus support on longer-term recovery efforts run by local organizations to address food insecurity.</p>

            <p>In countries affected by emergencies, children lose their loved ones and homes. They lose access to safe drinking water, health care and food. They lose safety and routine. And, without access to education, they risk losing their futures.
