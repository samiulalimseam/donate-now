        <p>Since May 2022, Bangladesh has been hit with one of the worst floods in years, with millions in Sylhet and Sunamganj now homeless and without any belongings. Every person, family, and country affected by crisis deserves our attention and support.</p>

        <p>Nearly 2 million people across Sylhet Division inlcuding Sunamganj, Sylhet City, are at risk of starvation. The hunger crisis is expected to worsen over the coming months as prolonged drought and the lack of food supply continue to drive up starvation. A united and global response is vital for survival in these communities.</p>

        <h2>Our Donation Plan</h2>
        <p>All donations to this fund will support hunger relief efforts in Sylhet. Initially, the fund will help local, vetted partners address the affected communities' immediate needs, such as access to food, clean water, and basic sanitation. The fund will later transition to focus support on longer-term recovery efforts run by local organizations to address food insecurity.</p>

            <h3>Shelter for a family</h3>
            <p>The people of Bangladesh, a country prone to natural disasters, are familiar with the ‘Cyclone Shelter’. But the concept of flood shelter is relatively new. Traditionally, embankments are most commonly used as shelters during floods</p>

            <p>In countries affected by emergencies, children lose their loved ones and homes. They lose access to safe drinking water, health care and food. They lose safety and routine. And, without access to education, they risk losing their futures.
